# PhotoMosaic : Lightbox Bridge : iLightbox

This plugin automatically configures **PhotoMosaic for WordPress** to use the [**iLightbox**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-ilightbox/) plugin.

Download the [.zip](https://github.com/daylifemike/photomosaic-lightbox-bridge-ilightbox/archive/master.zip), upload it to your WordPress site, and activate.

There is no configuration necessary.

Once active, in the **PhotoMosaic : Lightbox Bridge : iLightbox** box on your WordPress Plugins page, you'll see a link called "Lightbox Plugin Detail".  Clicking it will open the Plugin Details for **iLightbox**.  If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so from the Plugin Details window.
